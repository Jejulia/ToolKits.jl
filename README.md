## Data maipulate
@pip, @pipas enable R's %>% and %<>% syntax. Arguments are seperated by space. Broadcasting and anonymous functions are supported; however, @pipas can only assign global variable.
## Package management
@activity enables Pkg.activity functionality. Environment name doesn't have to be quoted, and the shared argument is set true. This a convenient way to access existed environment in './.julia/environments'.
